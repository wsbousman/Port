# Portfolio

HTML & CSS for a simple web developer portfolio site with separate pages for "work," "about," and "contact." 

Linkedin, GitHub, and email naturally provided on the contact page.

Flexbox and media queries used to transition from row to column layout and resize elements according to screen size.
